## Project Goals
1. Data Ingestion – Automate data collection from multiple sources.
2. ETL System – Process raw data into a structured format for analysis.
3. Data Lake – Store and manage large-scale data in a centralized repository.
4. Scalability – Ensure the system can handle growing data volumes.
5. Cloud Integration – Utilize AWS for scalable data processing.
6. Reporting & Insights – Build dashboards to visualize trends and patterns.

## Technologies & Services Used
1. Amazon S3 – Secure and scalable object storage.
2. AWS IAM – Manage secure access to AWS resources.
3. Amazon QuickSight – BI tool for interactive dashboards.
4. AWS Glue – Serverless ETL for data transformation.
5. AWS Lambda – Serverless computing for automated workflows.
6. AWS Athena – SQL-based querying directly on S3 data.

## Dataset
The dataset comes from Kaggle, containing daily statistics on trending YouTube videos across multiple regions. It includes details such as video titles, channels, views, likes, tags, comments, and more.
